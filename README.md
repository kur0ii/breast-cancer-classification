![Project Cover](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/27/2002045438/1200/1200/0/180920-F-XXXXX-0001.JPG) 

## Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model to distinguish between benign and malignant breast tumors using features from breast biopsy samples. The model helps medical professionals diagnose breast cancer more accurately and swiftly.


## Features

- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Installation

Use `pip` to install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Improvement ideas

To deploy the breast cancer classification model and make it accessible via a web API, you can use **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
