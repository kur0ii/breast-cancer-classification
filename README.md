![Project Cover](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/27/2002045438/1200/1200/0/180920-F-XXXXX-0001.JPG) 

## Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model to distinguish between benign and malignant breast tumors using features from breast biopsy samples. We achieved an impressive accuracy of **99%** by fine-tuning the **logistic regression model**.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. It is available at the following link:
